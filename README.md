## Content

In this repository you find all of the 25 programs that created during the video sorted into 5 different folders for each discussed programming language.

For each language we have the following programs: `hello-world`, `hello-name`, `coditions`, `for-loop`, `while-loop` and `functions`.

## Changes

I will list all changes here that were done after the video was published to YouTube.

### Python

- Instead of using the sprintf syntax with %s and %d it is possible and way more readable to use python3's format strings for outputting data from variables. (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) Thanks to @gothicVI!
